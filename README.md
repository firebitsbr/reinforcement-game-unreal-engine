# reinforcement-game-unreal-engine
Thesis project for Bachelor of Engineering. Using reinforcement learning in video games.
Reinforcement learning algorithm can be found in Content->Scripts->NeuralNetwork.py

An agent controlled by a reinforcement learning algorithm learns to dodge projectiles. Game is made with Unreal Engine
and the reinforcement learning algorithm is made with Python. Learning is done with Q-Learning and a neural network. Solo project.

What I learned from this project:
- Unreal Engine
- Python
- Reinforcement Learning & Machine Learning
